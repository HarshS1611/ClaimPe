# Problem
The insurance industry faces a significant challenge of dealing with numerous insurance claims on a daily basis. Without proper verification mechanisms, fraudulent claims are becoming increasingly prevalent, leading to financial losses for insurance companies and higher premiums for policyholders. To address this problem, we have developed ClaimPe, a web application designed to detect and prevent fake insurance claims.

# Solution
ClaimPe offers a straightforward and efficient process for verifying the authenticity of insurance claims, thereby reducing fraud and benefiting both insurance companies and policyholders. Our solution involves a unique business model that requires claimants to stake a certain amount of coins or cash until their claims are approved. This approach serves multiple purposes:

## Fraud Analytical Engine: 
ClaimPe utilizes an advanced fraud analytical engine, which incorporates various methodologies such as business rules, predictive modeling, anomaly detection, and analysis. These techniques allow us to analyze vast amounts of data, identify patterns, and uncover hidden relationships that may indicate fraudulent activity.

## Suspicious Claim Identification: 
The fraud analytical engine evaluates each claim based on multiple factors, including historical data, claimant behavior, payment patterns, and other relevant information. By comparing the claim details against established patterns and known fraud indicators, we can identify claims that exhibit suspicious characteristics.

## Increasing Staked Amounts: 
When the fraud detection model determines a claim to be suspicious, ClaimPe automatically adjusts the staked amount required from the claimant. By increasing the stake, we introduce a higher financial commitment for the claimant, making it less attractive for fraudsters to proceed with false claims. This mechanism acts as a deterrent, as fraudsters are less likely to risk a significant sum of money on a claim they know to be fraudulent.

## Low Staked Amounts for Legitimate Claims: 
In contrast, when a claim is deemed non-suspicious by our fraud detection model, the staked amount remains low. This approach ensures that honest policyholders are not burdened with excessive financial requirements when filing legitimate claims. By keeping the staked amount reasonable, we provide a seamless and user-friendly experience for genuine claimants.

## Predictive Modeling: 
The fraud analytical engine utilizes predictive modeling techniques to identify potential fraudulent claims. By analyzing various features and attributes associated with each claim, the model learns to recognize patterns indicative of fraud. It considers factors such as claim amount, policyholder history, claim type, geographical location, and other relevant variables to assess the likelihood of a claim being fraudulent.

## Anomaly Detection: 
ClaimPe employs anomaly detection algorithms to identify claims that deviate significantly from normal patterns. By establishing a baseline of expected behavior, the system can flag claims that exhibit unusual or unexpected characteristics. These anomalies may include excessive claim amounts, unusual claim submission patterns, or inconsistencies in the provided information.

## Continuous Improvement: 
ClaimPe's fraud detection capabilities are continually refined and updated based on new fraud patterns and evolving techniques. Our analytical engine learns from historical data and adapts to emerging trends, enabling us to stay ahead of fraudsters and improve the accuracy of our claim evaluations over time.

# About the model:
## Dataset and Data Preprocessing: 
The "Medical Insurance" dataset available on Kaggle provides a collection of historical insurance claim data, including both legitimate and fraudulent cases. ClaimPe utilizes this dataset for training its fraud detection model. Before training the model, the dataset undergoes preprocessing, which involves data cleaning, transformation, and normalization. This step ensures that the data is in a suitable format for analysis and model training.

## Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): 
ClaimPe performs exploratory data analysis on the medical insurance dataset to gain insights into the data and understand its characteristics. EDA involves visualizing and summarizing the data to identify patterns, correlations, and potential fraud indicators. This analysis helps in feature selection and engineering, allowing the model to capture the most relevant information for fraud detection.

## Feature Engineering: 
Feature engineering is a critical step in training an effective fraud detection model. ClaimPe performs feature engineering by selecting, creating, and transforming features that are likely to be informative for identifying fraudulent claims. This process may involve extracting statistical information from the data, creating new features based on domain knowledge, or applying techniques such as dimensionality reduction.

## Model Training: 
ClaimPe employs the Scikit-learn library in Python, which offers a wide range of machine learning algorithms and tools. The mentioned algorithms, including Simple Logistic Regression, Random Forest, Decision Trees, and XGBoost, are commonly used for fraud detection tasks. These algorithms are trained on the preprocessed and engineered dataset to learn the patterns and characteristics associated with fraudulent claims.

## Model Evaluation: 
After training the fraud detection model, it is evaluated using testing data to assess its performance and generalization ability. The mentioned training accuracy of 0.99 and testing accuracy of 0.85 suggest that the model achieved high accuracy on the training data, indicating its ability to learn from the provided information. The testing accuracy serves as an estimate of how well the model can predict fraud on unseen data.
